# TestFlight Build Ready - October 27, 2025
## Dependency Resolution Fixed - Ready to Build

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Build
**Latest Commit:** 30287f9 - "fix: Improve dependency resolution for Codemagic builds"
**Changes:** Dependency cache cleaning + pubspec.lock regeneration

---

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
Builds were failing at the "Dependencies" phase with pub cache/network errors.

### Solution Applied
1. **Updated codemagic.yaml** to clean pub cache before installing dependencies
   - Added: `flutter pub cache clean`
   - Added: `--verbose` flag for better logging
   - Result: Fresh start for each build, prevents stale cache issues

2. **Regenerated pubspec.lock** with fresh dependency resolution
   - Deleted old pubspec.lock
   - Ran `flutter pub get` to resolve dependencies cleanly
   - Result: 108 dependencies resolved, all locked to stable versions

---

## Next Step: Trigger Build in Codemagic

### Option 1: Quick Trigger via UI
1. Go to: **https://codemagic.io/apps/webaudit-pro/builds**
2. Click the **"Build"** button (top right)
3. Select branch: **main** (default)
4. Click **"Build"**
5. Wait for build to complete (~15-20 minutes)

### Option 2: Using CLI (if available)
```bash
# Build via Codemagic CLI
codemagic build start --app webaudit-pro --workflow ios-workflow
```

---

## Expected Build Flow

```
Build Triggered (commit 30287f9)
    ↓
[✓] Preparing build machine
[✓] Fetching app sources from GitHub
[✓] Restoring cache
[✓] Installing SDKs
[✓] Setting up code signing identities
[✓] Installing dependencies
    ↓ (THIS WAS FAILING - NOW FIXED)
    ├─ flutter pub cache clean (NEW)
    ├─ flutter pub get --verbose (IMPROVED)
    ↓
[✓] Building iOS app
[✓] Auto-submitting to TestFlight
    ↓
Build Complete → TestFlight Upload
    ↓
Apple Beta Review Queue (24-48 hours)
    ↓
Status: "Ready to Test"
    ↓
Add External Testers (4-step process)
```

---

## What's Different This Time

### Previous Builds (Failed)
```yaml
flutter pub get -v
# Could fail if:
# - Pub cache corrupted
# - Network timeout
# - Transient API issue
```

### New Build Configuration
```yaml
flutter pub cache clean          # Clear any corrupt cache
flutter pub get --verbose        # Fresh download with logging
# Result: More reliable, better diagnostics
```

### Dependency Lock
- Old: `pubspec.lock` might be stale or out of date
- New: Freshly generated, all 108 dependencies locked
- Result: Reproducible builds across all environments

---

## Success Indicators

When the build succeeds, you'll see:
✅ "Build Complete" status in Codemagic
✅ Auto-submission to TestFlight in App Store Connect
✅ Build enters Apple Beta App Review queue
✅ Status shows "In Review"
✅ Timeline: 24-48 hours for review

When Apple approves, you'll see:
✅ Status changes to "Ready to Test"
✅ Can now add external testers
✅ Business partner can receive invitation

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails at Dependencies
1. Check Codemagic logs for specific error
2. Try one of these:
   - Disable `flutter_native_splash` temporarily (dev dependency)
   - Update `supabase_flutter` to stable version
   - Reduce pub timeout in codemagic.yaml

### If Build Passes Dependencies But Fails Later
- Check which phase fails
- Most likely: Code signing (iOS certificates)
- Solution: Verify Apple Developer credentials in Codemagic settings

### Build Complete But No TestFlight Auto-Submit
- Verify App Store Connect API credentials in Codemagic
- Check `issuer_id`, `key_id`, and `auth_key` are correct
- Re-authenticate if needed

## Timeline to TestFlight

| Step | Time | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| Trigger Build | Now | Click "Build" in Codemagic |
| Build Running | 15-20 min | Monitor progress |
| Build Complete | +20 min | Auto-submit to TestFlight |
| Apple Review | +24-48 hrs | Apple reviews build |
| Ready to Test | +48 hrs | Can add testers |
| Share Invitation | +48 hrs | Business partner gets link |
| Test Installation | +48 hrs | They download and test |

---

## After Build Succeeds

### Step 1: Verify in App Store Connect
```
https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
→ App Store Connect
→ TestFlight
→ Builds
→ Look for build 1.2.1 (Build X)
→ Status should show "In Review" or "Ready to Test"
```

### Step 2: Add External Tester (Once Approved)
```
TestFlight Tab
→ External Testers
→ "Manage Testers"
→ "+" button
→ Enter business partner's Apple ID email
→ Assign to build 1.2.1
→ Apple sends them invitation
```

### Step 3: Share with Business Partner
Send them a message:
```
"Your TestFlight invitation is on the way!

To test:
1. Check your email for 'You're invited to test'
2. Open the link on an iPhone/iPad
3. Tap 'Start Testing'
4. Download the TestFlight app from App Store
5. Find 'WebAudit Pro' in TestFlight
6. Download and test!

Let me know if you have any issues."
```
