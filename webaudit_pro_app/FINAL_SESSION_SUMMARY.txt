================================================================================
                      IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. AASA File Caching:
   - Apple caches apple-app-site-association for ~24 hours
   - After rebuilding app, changes take effect
   - No action needed, just awareness

2. Email Reputation:
   - Starts "poor" for new domains (normal)
   - Improves automatically with sending history
   - DKIM already configured to speed improvement
   - Won't block emails, just may hit spam initially

3. Two Callback Paths:
   - Windows: localhost:3000 (local server on user's machine)
   - iOS: websler.app (hosted on internet)
   - Both work simultaneously for different users

4. Testing Order:
   - Windows first (faster feedback)
   - iOS second (requires TestFlight build)
   - Both should work identically
