---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ‚úÖ Backend Implementation (Complete)
**Location**: `C:\Users\Ntro\weblser\fastapi_server.py`

**New Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/compliance-audit` - Main compliance analysis endpoint
- `GET /api/compliance-audit/{compliance_id}` - Retrieve specific audit

- `GET /api/compliance/generate-pdf/{compliance_id}` - PDF generation and download

**Features**:
- Multi-jurisdiction analysis (AU, NZ, GDPR, CCPA)
- JWT extraction from Authorization headers for user authentication
- Supabase integration with RLS enforcement
- Claude AI integration for intelligent compliance analysis
- ReportLab PDF generation with company branding support

### 2. ‚úÖ Database Schema (Complete)
**Location**: Supabase Staging (kmlhslmkdnjakkpluwup)

**New Tables**:
- `compliance_audits` - Main audit records with jurisdiction scores

- `compliance_jurisdiction_scores` - Normalized jurisdiction-specific scores

**Features**:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforcing user data isolation
- Performance indexes on frequently queried columns
- Cascading deletes for data integrity
- JSONB storage for flexible finding structures

### 3. ‚úÖ Frontend Implementation (Complete)

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VPS Backend Status
The FastAPI backend on 140.99.254.83:8000 did not respond during testing. This could be:
- Service not running after server reboot

- Firewall blocking
- Service crash

**Action Required**:
```bash
# SSH into VPS and check status
ssh root@140.99.254.83

# Check service
systemctl status websler-api

# Restart if needed
systemctl restart websler-api

# Check logs
journalctl -u websler-api -n 100
```

### Database Connection
Both staging and production Supabase databases have:
- ‚úÖ Compliance audit tables created
- ‚úÖ RLS policies configured
- ‚úÖ Indexes created for performance
