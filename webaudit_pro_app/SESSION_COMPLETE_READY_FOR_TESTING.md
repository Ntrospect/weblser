## üìä Email Verification Architecture

### How It Works - Windows Desktop
```
1. User signs up on Windows app
2. AuthService calls Supabase signUp()
3. Supabase sends email from noreply@websler.app
4. Email contains: http://localhost:3000?token=ABC123
5. User clicks link in email
6. Browser opens localhost:3000
7. App's callback server receives request on port 3000
8. Token extracted from query parameter: ?token=ABC123
9. AuthService monitors for token in callback handler
10. Token detected ‚Üí verifyOTP(token) called
11. Supabase verifies token and issues JWT session
12. AuthService receives session token
13. User auto-logged in
14. Home screen displays with user's email
```

### How It Works - iOS (Deep Linking)
```
1. User signs up on iPhone app
2. AuthService calls Supabase signUp()
3. Supabase sends email from noreply@websler.app
4. Email contains: https://websler.app/verify?token=ABC123
5. User taps link in email on iPhone
6. iOS checks apple-app-site-association on websler.app
7. iOS recognizes app is associated with domain
8. iOS opens Websler app directly (not Safari)
9. Deep link passed to app with ?token=ABC123
10. AuthService extracts token from deep link
11. AuthService monitors for token in callback handler
12. Token detected ‚Üí verifyOTP(token) called
13. Supabase verifies token and issues JWT session
14. AuthService receives session token
15. User auto-logged in
16. Home screen displays with user's email
```

- **Spam**: <5% (DKIM verified, reputation good)
- **Bounced**: <2% (valid email addresses)

### User Experience Target
- **Auto-login**: 100% on email click
- **Loading time**: <2 seconds for email link click to home screen
- **Error messages**: Clear and actionable if anything fails

## üéì Key Learnings This Session

### iOS Deep Linking
- apple-app-site-association is critical for Universal Links
- Team ID + Bundle ID format must be exact: `TEAMID.BUNDLEID`
- File must be at `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` (no extension)
- Hostinger can automatically set up DKIM records
- Email reputation improves automatically with good sending practices

### Production Architecture
- Localhost callbacks work great for desktop apps
- Deep linking provides native experience on mobile
- Same email verification flow works for both platforms
- SMTP credentials safely encrypted in Supabase
- No need to change code - existing callback handler supports both

### Testing Strategy
- Windows testing first (faster feedback)
- iOS testing via TestFlight (real device testing)
- Share progress with business partner early
- Monitor console logs for debugging

---

**Your WebAudit Pro app is production-ready for email verification testing!**

All infrastructure is in place:
- Email verification works for Windows and iOS
- Professional email domain configured
- Apple app association file deployed
