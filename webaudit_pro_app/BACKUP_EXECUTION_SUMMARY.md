- [x] Commit all files to git
- [x] Push to GitHub
- [x] Create git tag for easy reference
- [ ] **PENDING**: Distribute this document to team

### Short Term (This Week)
- [ ] Run through emergency recovery procedures (test drill)
- [ ] Verify all team members have access to GitHub
- [ ] Test web deployment from scratch
- [ ] Test backend restart procedure
- [ ] Verify database backup restore works

### Medium Term (This Month)
- [ ] Set up automated monitoring (uptime checks)
- [ ] Create incident response runbook
- [ ] Schedule monthly disaster recovery drills
- [ ] Implement git-crypt for .env backup
- [ ] Document DNS records in project

### Long Term (Phase 6+)
- [ ] Advanced filtering and batch operations
- [ ] API key management for programmatic access
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Scheduled audit functionality
- [ ] Custom evaluation criteria

---

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Constraints
1. **Offline queue persistence** - Stored locally only; if app crashes, queue may be lost
2. **Image uploads** - Not yet implemented; avatars default only
3. **Social sharing** - Not yet implemented
4. **Advanced filtering** - History view shows all analyses
5. **Batch operations** - Can't bulk delete/export yet

### Workarounds
1. Save offline data frequently by syncing
2. Use default avatars (profile pictures not critical)
3. Share links manually via email/chat
4. Download individual PDFs instead of bulk export
5. Delete items one at a time

### Roadmap Items
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Batch delete/export operations
- [ ] Scheduled audits
- [ ] API access with API keys
- [ ] Team collaboration and role-based access
- [ ] Custom audit templates
- [ ] Report scheduling and email delivery
