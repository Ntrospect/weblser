## What We Accomplished This Session

### Phase 1: Document Review

**Time Spent:** 15 minutes
**Documents Reviewed:** 4 planning documents

#### Findings from Review:

‚úÖ **Strengths Identified:**
- Excellent structure (week-by-week breakdown)
- Technically accurate (all bash commands production-ready)
- Comprehensive coverage (infrastructure, integration, templates, docs, adoption)
- Clear deliverables and success criteria
- Risk mitigation included
- Excellent for execution

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Found & Recommendations:**
1. **Timeline Inconsistency** - Said "3-6 months" in header but showed 6 weeks in detail
   - Recommendation: Standardize to 6 weeks (Oct 28 - Dec 9, 2025)

2. **Missing Team Member Names** - Placeholders like [Name], [Email], [Insert Date]
   - Recommendation: Fill in actual names before team review

3. **VPS Deployment Assumptions** - Not confirmed:
   - OS version (assumes Ubuntu/Debian)
   - Existing software stack
   - Whether www-data user exists
   - Recommendation: Add pre-deployment verification checks

4. **Backend Integration Ambiguity** - Unclear if templates should be:
   - Symlinked or copied
   - Shared location or duplicated
   - Recommendation: Add decision matrix for template sharing options

5. **Missing: Domain & SSL Pre-checks** - DNS configuration not verified
   - Recommendation: Add DNS verification to pre-deployment checklist

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Comprehensive Planning First** - Creating complete docs before execution prevents surprises
2. **Organized Structure** - Dedicated folder makes it easy to manage and share
3. **Multiple Navigation Methods** - Index + README + individual doc TOCs = easy to find anything
4. **Role-Specific Paths** - Developers don't need to read all 14 docs, just their 3-4 relevant ones
5. **Troubleshooting First** - Including 27 issues and solutions ahead of time saves time during execution
6. **GitHub Backup** - Immediate backup prevents losing work

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Placeholder Cleanup** - Should have filled in actual names/emails before finalizing
2. **VPS Pre-Checks** - Should have added more verification steps upfront
3. **Decision Documentation** - Some ambiguous items (symlink vs copy) should have been resolved
4. **Team Input Earlier** - Could have included team leads in planning docs sooner

---

## Questions for Next Session

These items need decision-making or clarification before Phase 1 Week 1 begins:

1. **Who are the actual 5 team members?**
   - DevOps Lead: [Name]
   - Backend Developer: [Name]
   - Product Manager: [Name]
   - Designer: [Name]
   - Technical Writer: [Name]

2. **What is the actual VPS configuration?**
   - OS: Ubuntu 20.04? 22.04?
   - Python version: 3.11? 3.12?
   - Existing services running?
   - Available disk/memory?

3. **Template sharing approach - which one?**
   - Option A: Symlink from /var/www/weblser/templates/
   - Option B: Copy templates to shared location
   - Option C: Backend reads from PDF Maker directly

4. **VPS deployment timeline - when to start?**
   - Week of Oct 28?
   - Week of Nov 4?
   - Different date?

5. **Leadership approval - who signs?**
   - CEO/Co-founder?
   - Project sponsor?
   - Both?
