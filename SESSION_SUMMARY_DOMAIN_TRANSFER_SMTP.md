## Email Template Journey (Problem-Solving Summary)

### Problems Encountered & Solved

1. **Spam Filter Warnings** (SpamAssassin)
   - Issues: WEIRD_PORT (8000), NORMAL_HTTP_TO_IP, URI_NOVOWEL (long consonants)
   - Solution: Switch from VPS URLs to domain-based URLs (https://jumoki.com/assets/)
   - Result: All warnings eliminated

2. **Logo Hosting**
   - Initial approach: Supabase Storage ‚Üí Spam warnings
   - Attempted fix: CNAME to assets.jumoki.com ‚Üí SSL mismatch errors
   - Final solution: Host on Hostinger's public_html/assets/ directory
   - Works perfectly: https://jumoki.com/assets/*.png

3. **Non-Clickable Button & Invisible Link**
   - Problem: Button rendered in Supabase preview but not clickable in Gmail/Outlook
   - Root cause: Email clients handle styled HTML differently than browsers
   - Solution: Simplified HTML structure, removed complex CSS classes, used inline styles
   - Result: Both button and visible fallback link now work

4. **Template Rendering Issues**
   - Problem: Supabase preview showed template, but actual emails used default plain-text template
   - Root cause: Supabase rejects unsupported template syntax silently and falls back
   - Examples of rejected syntax:
     - `{{ .Email | replace "@" " " | trimRight | title }}` (pipe filters unsupported)
     - Complex nested CSS classes
   - Solution: Use basic inline styles only, minimal template variables

### Current Template Features
- ‚úÖ Professional purple gradient header
- ‚úÖ Dual logo display (Websler Pro + Jumoki)
- ‚úÖ Prominent "Confirm Email Address" button (clickable)
- ‚úÖ Feature highlights list
- ‚úÖ Security note about link expiration
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ Email-client compatible (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Verification link visible and clickable
- ‚úÖ Hosted logos (no attachment bloat)

## Custom SMTP Strategy

### Why Hostinger SMTP Instead of Supabase Built-In
- Supabase built-in has rate limits (not for production)
- Hostinger gives full control over email delivery
- Better HTML rendering in email clients
- Integrates with domain's email infrastructure
- Avoids external dependencies

### Hostinger SMTP Setup (Once Transfer Completes)

**Steps to Complete:**
1. Domain transfer completes (5-7 business days from Oct 25)
2. Confirm MX records in Hostinger
3. Create `noreply@jumoki.com` email account
4. Get SMTP credentials:
   - SMTP Host: (likely `smtp.jumoki.com` or `mail.jumoki.com`)
   - SMTP Port: 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS)
   - Username: `noreply@jumoki.com`
   - Password: (to be set during account creation)
5. Add SPF record in Hostinger DNS (no premium charge!)
6. Test SMTP connectivity
7. Configure in Supabase:
   - Authentication ‚Üí Email Templates ‚Üí SMTP Settings
   - Fill in Host, Port, Username, Password
8. Test end-to-end with signup flow

## Product Strategy (Websler Pro - 2-in-1 Positioning)

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Digital agencies (web design, SEO, digital marketing)
- **Secondary**: Freelance web developers
- **Internal**: Jumoki's own client work (dogfooding)

### Unique Positioning
- Built BY an agency FOR agencies
- Jumoki uses it internally = real testimonials
- Solve problems Jumoki actually faces

---

## Feature Implementation Estimates

**Why**: Makes audits a client deliverable, enables sharing
- Frontend: 3-4 hours
- Backend: 1-2 hours
- Database: 30 min
- Testing: 1-2 hours

- Database: 0 hours (store settings locally)
- Testing: 1-2 hours
- **Total: 3-5 hours (half day)**

**Quick Win**: This is nearly free because your PDF backend is already built!

---

### Priority 2: Competitor Comparison üéØ
**Why**: Shows relative positioning, justifies fees, major sales tool
- Frontend: 5-7 hours (UI for adding/comparing competitors)
- Backend: 2-3 hours (comparison endpoint)
